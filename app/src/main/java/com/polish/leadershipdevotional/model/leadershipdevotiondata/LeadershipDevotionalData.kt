A common feature you observe in a relationship that has a well built trust structure are: submission to authority, submission to one another, genuine brotherly love amongst the brethren, genuine commitment to personal growth with an intent to abound towards every good works, etc.\n" +

Statements like these are symptoms of fear; how will they feel when I do this, I hope what I did was good enough, etc.. These are symptoms of fear because one tends to seek approval from some one before one act. Let’s bring to mind that seeking counsel is quiet different from this. Fear makes one indecisive; on the other hand when one seeks counsel, he has already decide to find a solution.\n" +

Not by the works of man, neither did man save himself or gave himself a calling rather out of the mercy of God before the world began it was already planned(Jer.29:11, Eph.1:4).\n" +

Paul the Apostle after some time in the word, he caught a revelation of who he is and where to function. What it cost is what you will find Paul did in the following verse (Gal.1:16-18).\n" +

            "This man (Paul the Apostle) had a working knowledge of God such that the afflictions, sufferings , lack that he received were not to be compared to the assurance he had in God. That assurance was comforting enough; this is how our relationship with God must be developed.\n" +
                    "This is a prayer of commitment which a born again child of God must constantly practice, Paul the Apostle gave an illustration on how to practice it(Roman12:1).\n" +
                    "I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.\n" +

                    "You will observe in that scripture that it was by the reception of mercy before a commitment is made. Paul’s encounter with Jesus Christ on his way to Damascus was an act of mercy to Paul. From then on he began to make his commitment to God. \n" +
                    "The mercy of God is opened to every man, everyone on the face of the earth (matt.). And that is saying; my son you can trust me, take my hand…… You know what, His mercy makes one to live an everlasting life (Psalm103:17).\n" +

            "Even Paul the Apostle faced rejection, when people reject you for your faith, believe, stand. How do you handle it? Paul the Apostle was not bitter about it; he only made known to his close brethren what had happened. \n" +
                    "Let’s learn a lesson from the family of Jesus at the conception stage of Jesus (Matt1:18-24). Mary the mother of Jesus was about to be rejected by her fiancé (the one she was to be married to), even at that Mary was not worried. What a strong confidence, it only required time for whom she had believed (2Tim.1:12) and committed to , to prove Himself. Her countenance was perfect even at the verge of losing her proposed marriage. \n" +
                    "Whom she believed visited Joseph to explain the matter and that was how the proposed marriage was saved.\n" +
                    "Those that reject you or leave you, they are probably not part of fulfilling your destiny. Therefore, if you really have committed to Him whom you believe as Mary did when she proclaimed: it is unto me according to thy word. So when rejection comes, you take it as an opportunity or a room being created for the true destiny partners to come to you.\n" +
                    "You a special person with a bright future, so as a magnet attract to itself, so likewise you have been wired to attract your destiny partners. \n",
            "This is an act of hospitality by Onesiphorus to Paul the Apostle, Paul asked God to bless him (Onesiphorus) with His mercy. An example of mercy is as the one Abraham found such that God said to Him; you are my friend. This friendship made him to have a place in heaven and a man of power, wealth on the earth at that time.\n" +
                    "So you see, it is a privilege to offer hospitality to people, likewise men of God or servants of the Living God because God has placed a blessing of mercy for such an act.\n" +
                    "In Genesis18:1-10, this account is very explanatory on how to receive by faith the mercy of God in any area of one’s life. At the beginning of the account it says; “And the LORD appeared unto him (Abraham)… Every man can sense when God is touching him or her (Luke2:14), that is the time anyone must listen for the wisdom needed from God to act (Psalm46:10). Abraham got the signal and he observed diligently until he got information on what he must do. As he did that, such act can be described as humility to God. Hence, he was exalted with a child; his most earnest expectation was fulfilled (Proverbs22:4).\n" +

            "There is always a room to do better and hence expand the reach on your products, services or ministry. Therefore, as a leader, you got the task to select people to work with you such that the purpose of the product, services and ministry is fulfilled.\n" +
                    "Such a leader is identified as one who was once a follower, one who has learnt how to lead. One character of a potential leader is one who has been consistent on little or big things he does for himself or others. And of course, he enjoys doing it; it comes out with remarkable results. The teenage boy David is a typical example, likewise, Joseph as a teenager.\n" +

                    "One weapon of the Soldier is the sword of the Spirit (Eph.6:17b), which is the word of God. The word of God is powerful, sharper than two edge sword (Heb.4:12), as a medicine, it is very effective for every situation.\n" +

                    "Dan 3:28  Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God. \n" +

In such a relationship God demands that one has to study to show himself or herself approved, not to men rather only to God.

Such has all he or she needs to be fulfilled in life and enjoy life (2Pt.1:3). Therefore, the process of building this relationship is what Paul the Apostle refers to as “working out your own salvation” (Phil.2:12). In this relationship communication develops just as a Father would relate to his son, the Holy Spirit becomes very instrumental day by day as a comforter (John14:26). This were one will receive instructions expressly from God Almighty Himself on how to make herself or himself approved unto God.\n" +

            "Paul the Apostle was very explicit here, strong words indeed, describing to everyone how valuable godly living is to God and man. Because one who has received the righteousness of God will take a conscious step to walk in the love of God even when the situation might not look favourable. For example, since the law is fulfilled in love (Rom.13:10), therefore godliness (which is having the nature of God) will not steal, will not kill, will not commit adultery, will not bear false witness against his or her neighbor, etc (Deut.5:7-21). Ungodliness on the other side will bring chaos to any society; the act of ungodliness by Adam brought a curse to the ground (Gen.3:17-19) and displaced him from his loving home (Eden, Gen.3:23-24). Likewise the people Israel did not get to promise land by their grumbling which was an act of ungodliness ().\n" +
                    "Now Paul the Apostle instructs, watch out for profane and vain babblings, they will make one to walk in ungodliness as exemplified above. The meaning of the following words will help to understand the step to take:\n" +

Anyone that trusts God will receive instruction on how to act or exercise his or her faith in God. It was faith that made Noah to construct that ark; likewise as we fellowship with the father we begin to discover what to do. This also will define who we relate with.\n" +
