                    "Likewise the love of God is opened to you, if you have not received Jesus as your Lord and savior. You need to believe in your heart that Jesus was sent by God to die for you on the cross that you will have this new life in Christ Jesus (Romans10:10). For all sin and came short of the glory of God. Man went into the dark with no sense of peace but now through Jesus Christ, we make peace with God (Rom.5:1).\n" +

            "The act of thanksgiving is a way of making one’s self available for the master’s use, for we understand that we are vessels(carrier of purpose) empowered to carryout good works(2Tim2:20-21). Paul acknowledged the heroes of faith like Abraham, Isaac, David, Joseph, Moses who had the same precious faith as his. He was observing how these people got their inheritance from God (Heb.6:12) with sincerity of heart and in love.\n" +

                    "There is joy fellowshipping with God Almighty. Likewise joy helps to sharpen the vision you have received and supplies the courage to commit to it until it is fulfilled. This was the scenario between Mary and Elizabeth. In that scene is a perfect description of fellowshipping; Elizabeth confirmed what Mary had received, while to Mary it was an in-filling with joy that broke into thanksgiving (Luke1:39-56).\n" +

A common feature you observe in a relationship that has a well built trust structure are: submission to authority, submission to one another, genuine brotherly love amongst the brethren, genuine commitment to personal growth with an intent to abound towards every good works, etc.\n" +
                    "With keen observation here, we find out that it was consistency on a particular virtue in the life of Timothy’s grandmother, mother and in Timothy himself that persuaded Paul the Apostle to vouch that Timothy will always be true to faith of Christ Jesus which he has received without pretence.\n" +

This is a challenge that must be overcome because there is always a sense of fulfillment when anyone releases his God-given gift. That fulfillment is the joy of living; though one would need to count the cost (Luke).\n",
            "We know that fear is an enemy to growth; it prevents people from expressing themselves or from expressing the gift of God in them. Statements like these are symptoms of fear; how will they feel when I do this, I hope what I did was good enough, etc.. These are symptoms of fear because one tends to seek approval from some one before one act. Let’s bring to mind that seeking counsel is quiet different from this. Fear makes one indecisive; on the other hand when one seeks counsel, he has already decide to find a solution.\n" +
                    "Therefore, we may say here that one reason fear is present is because of the absent of truth(Prov19:2a, John8:32). By this scripture above, we could observe that Timothy was timid. To set him free from timidity, he gave him this truth…..  Timothy look up, you have the spirit of power, the spirit of love, the spirit of sound mind; begin to exercise yourself in this truth, Paul the Apostle instructed.\n" +

            "As a new believer the first testimony you have is “the new creation you are (2Cor5:17)”, you can explain the transformation that happened to you at that encounter with the Lord Jesus Christ. One common symptom of being ashamed is withdrawal from carrying on an activity or an exercise or an action.\n" +
